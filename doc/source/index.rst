Welcome to sup-dto's documentation!
===================================

**sup-dto** is a C++ library for Data Transfer Objects, used in the Supervision and Automation
System (SUP). It provides generic data types and values for reliable and easy transfer of structured
values across architectural boundaries. The values are designed to respect value semantics, allowing
them to be easily returned from functions/methods and avoiding issues with object slicing. The API
is designed to be easy to use and intuitive.
