Changes for 1.5.0:

- SW QA: unit now passing Sonar report
- Changed C++ standard to C++17

Changes for 1.4.0:

- Improve code quality

Changes for 1.3.0:

- Bugfix (COA-741): unable to parse structured AnyValue with empty member

Changes for 1.2.0:

- Added binary serialization/parsing without restrictions, as opposed to C-type casting
- Added compact string serialization for use on terminals
- QA: all blocker and critical issues resolved; most major issues resolved.
- API changes:

- More relaxed AnyType/AnyValue assignments and modification, while at the same time enforcing
  strict type equality of array elements
