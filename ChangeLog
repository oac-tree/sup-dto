Changes for 1.2.0:

- Added binary serialization/parsing without restrictions, as opposed to C-type casting
- Added compact string serialization for use on terminals
- QA: all blocker and critical issues resolved; most major issues resolved.
- API changes:
  - Casting an AnyValue to a C-type is now done through the 'ToCType' member function template, while
    the 'As' member function template is reserved for scalar extraction and copying.

- More relaxed AnyType/AnyValue assignments and modification, while at the same time enforcing
  strict type equality of array elements
