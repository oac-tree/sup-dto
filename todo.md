* Provide non-throwing implementations for assignment, serialization, parsing, etc.
* Cast from C-type
* Support for enumerations
* Provide depth-first iterator (currently IAnyVisitorNode<const T> and derived classes) and expose this as a generic way to visit all nodes in an AnyType/AnyValue tree
* Complete documentation (mostly serialize/parse)
* Encode AnyType to AnyValue and back
